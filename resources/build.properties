# Customize the build properties to make the ant-build-process work for your 
# environment. How? Please read the comments below.

# The default properties are set for OSX, for Windows-settings please refer to 
# comments made under (1) and (2).

# Set the java version that should be used to compile your tool.

java.target.version=1.6


# Set the description of the Ant build.xml file.

ant.description=ProcessingTools Ant build file.

# Project details.
# Give your tool a name.
# When creating a tool, the name of the main class which implements Tool must be
# the same as the value defined for project.name in your build.properties.

project.name=BlocksTool


# Use 'normal' or 'fast' as value for project.compile.
# 'fast' will only compile the project into your sketchbook.
# 'normal' will compile the distribution including the javadoc-reference and all
# web-files (the compile process here takes longer).

# All files compiled with project.compile=normal are stored 
# in the distribution folder.

# If you need more control, you can edit web/index.html and web/tool.properties 
# directly.
